📁Part A — Theory (Short Questions)
1. Nine Pillars Understanding
- Why is using AI Development Agents (like Gemini CLI) for repetitive setup tasks better for your growth as a system architect?
AI Development Agents repetitive setup handle kar lete hain, jis se humhara time bach jata hai aur hum system-level soch sakte ho. Hum code likhne ke bajaye architecture, planning aur intent par focus karte ho — jo ek system architect ki growth ke liye essential hai.

- Explain how the Nine Pillars of AIDD help a developer grow into an M-Shaped Developer?
Ye nine pillars developer ko AI se collaborate karne mai help karte hai, har pillar developer ko ek nayi capability deta hai jaise ke reasoning karna, specification writing, architecture thinking etc in mai se ek bhi skip nhi kia ja sakta ye sab pilars developer ko M-shaped developer banate hai.

2. Vibe Coding vs Specification-Driven Development
- Why does Vibe Coding usually create problems after one week?
Vibe coding phele dino mai fast, experimental hoti hai and unstable bhi then after a 1 week problems ajati hai system ko koi clear specification nhi milti then system give unpredictable output our messy hojata hai multiple error create karta hai.

- How would Specification-Driven Development prevent those problems?
Specification-Driven development is liye problems ko rok deta hai kyun ke hum usko clear structured specs dete hai. jab AI ke pass proper specifation hogi to problem create nhi honge jis woh se stable output dega.

3. Architecture Thinking
- How does architecture-first thinking change the role of a developer in AIDD?
Architecture-first thinking developer ka role change kar deti hai woh code writer se orchestrator ban janta hai yani AI ko guide karta hai use kaam kis tarh karna hai. Human structure decide karta hai, manual thinking, high level desicion leta hai AI simply coding ko handle karta hai.

- Explain why developers must think in layers and systems instead of raw code.
AIDD ke daur mein system ko raw code ki bajaye 3-layer architecture par design kiya jata hai: Intent → Agents → Model. Developer ko layers aur system-level thinking adopt karni parti hai, kyun ke AI agents multiple workflows ko connect karte hai. Agar hum system ko layer-based structure ke saath design nahi karte, to AI ka collaboration break ho jata hai
